# How to Get a Raspberry Pi

1. Follow [@rpilocator](https://twitter.com/rpilocator) on Twitter
    - This account runs a webscraper across a ton of websites. So that means as soon as it is listed on the website you will get a notification. 
    - This is better than signing up for stock alerts directly through the website because you don't have to wait to get to the front of the line to get notified.
    - Turn on alerts for posts.

2. Set up your Adafruit account
    - Adafruit has had the most reliable supply of pis in the US. They usually have 100 pis in stock every Wednesday around 9am Mountain time. BUT they have very strict requirements to obtain a pi through them.
    - Only one pi per user/location. They monitor all purchases and will cancel your order if your account has ordered more than one.
    - Please follow these instructions carefully.
        - Create an account.
        - Set up 2FA
        - IMPORTANT: LOG OUT AND BACK IN
        - Save your shipping and billing address
        - Save your card
        - Add the pi and any accessories to your wishlist (i.e. power supply, micro sd card, etc)

3. Wait for an alert!
    - Alerts can come in at any day and time, so be ready
    - Adafruit has consistently listed ~100 units of Raspberry Pi 4b (of varrying sizes) every Wednesday between 9am and 10am Mountain Time. I reccomend having the webpage open and ready to go right at 9. (set a reminder on your phone!)

4. Check out fast!
    - From the time you get the alert you have about 1 minute before they are gone. 
    - Add all items from your wishlist to your cart.
    - Click through the checkout fast. No time to be picky.
    - There is no free shipping. 5 day shipping is like $17. Thats just the way it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    - If you get the confirmation email then you did it!!
